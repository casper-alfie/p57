        <p>my fav book............Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - a very interesting book filled with plot twist and exciting adventures. At the time I found that Barty Couch Jr was pretending to be Alastar Moody I was really shocked . After I watched the movie , what is wrong and why are all the classes missing!? and that too the movie is too long and cant cover everything. Order of Phoenix is the biggest book and has 1 movie on that while deathly hallows is a small book and still has 2 parts in movies - nothing makes sense !! Nevertheless it is a lovely book - #booksarebetterthanmovies
